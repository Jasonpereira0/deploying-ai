    "# Evaluating Model Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to obtain and use logprobs from the Completions API. Many of these examples are adapted from the [\"Using logprobs\" from the OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/using_logprobs#0-imports-and-utils).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logprobs and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to notice is that the Responses and Completions APIs can return logprobs. Not every model provider will return logprobs. Two key parameters to obtain logprobs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `logprobs`: whether to retunr the log rpobabilities of the output tokens. If true, returns the logprobs of each output token returned in the content message.\n",
    "- `top_logprobs`: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. This parameter requires `logprobs = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log probabilities or logprobs are $log(p)$ where $p$ is the probability of a token occurring at a specific position based on the previous tokens in the context."
